# Students-Affairs app

Desktop Application for Student Affairs System using Java JDBC driver and GUI using FXML.

This application is a student affairs application designed to manage students of FCI MU (Faculty of Computing and Information at Menoufia University).

This is a complete desktop application with data base it's features are recording new students , recording new employees , record grades of students 
, calculate GPA of student , recording the new subjects after calculating GPA and determine what number of subjects that he has to record in current
term and there is a report which say what is the largest degree in every subject and sorted them.

I implemented some items in the college list.

This application contains two tables in the database.

  1-Users table: which contains the user name, password and ID of the affairs administrator.
     
  2- Student's table: which contains the full name, ID, city, phone, department, date of birth, and materials.
 
To use this application you have to create a database that you can go to (database/users table) and copy SQL and create a table for users.
And students go to (Database/studentsTable) and copy the sql and create a student table.
