Student Affairs Application (JavaFX) Connect with Database (MySQL)

This application is a student affairs application designed for the administration of FCI MU (Faculty of Computing and Information at Menoufia University).

I implemented some items in the college list.

List of colleges I worked on("https://drive.google.com/file/d/1e5Bs3kpcLBQEFGGeSeJEK5jDRvABzku7/view")


This application contains two tables in the database.
     1-Users table: which contains the user name, password and ID of the affairs administrator.
     
     2- Student's table: which contains the full name, ID, city, phone, department, date of birth, and materials.
 
To use this application you have to create a database that you can go to (database/users table) and copy SQL and create a table for users.
And students go to (Database/studentsTable) and copy the sql and create a student table.
